# Diverse Conditional Image Generation by Stochastic Regression with Latent Drop-Out Codes

Source code for "Learning Dilation Factors for Semantic Segmentation of Street Scenes (ECCV2018)"
We modified the convolution layer in standard Caffe deep learning framework.
This is a demo to train a Deeplab-LargeFOV semantic segmentation model with our learnable dilated convolution networks.

## Prerequisites
- Linux or OSX.
- Python 2 or Python 3.
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN.
